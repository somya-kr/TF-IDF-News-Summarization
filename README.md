# TF-IDF-News-Summarization
## Methodology for Summarizing News Articles
This code aims to summarize news articles using a TF-IDF based approach. The following methodology has been used:

### Loading the Dataset
The news articles dataset is loaded using pandas read_csv function.

### Splitting into Train and Test Sets
The dataset is split into a train set and a test set. The train set consists of 90% of the data, while the test set consists of the remaining 10%.

### Preprocessing
A function preprocess is defined to preprocess the text data. The function performs the following operations:

### Converts the text to lowercase
Tokenizes the text into words
Removes stopwords and punctuation
Joins the words to form sentences
TF-IDF Vectorization
The test set is preprocessed using the preprocess function, and then the TF-IDF score is computed for each sentence in the test set using the TfidfVectorizer function from scikit-learn. The parameters used are:

ngram_range=(1, 2): considers both unigrams and bigrams
max_df=0.8: ignores words that occur in more than 80% of the documents
min_df=5: ignores words that occur in less than 5 documents
use_idf=True: uses inverse document frequency weighting
Sentence Scoring
The sentences in the test set are ranked based on their importance using the TF-IDF scores computed in the previous step. The top 30% of the sentences are selected as the summary for each article.

### Cleaning Responses
The selected sentences are removed from the original article to generate the cleaned response.

### ROUGE Score Calculation
The ROUGE score is calculated using the Rouge package, which computes the F1 score of the summary compared to the original article.

### Output
The cleaned responses for the test set along with ROUGE scores are printed.

### Parameters Used
The following parameters were used for the TF-IDF vectorization:

- `ngram_range=(1, 2)`: The range of n-grams considered for the TF-IDF score. The range is set to consider both unigrams and bigrams.
- `max_df=0.8`: The maximum document frequency allowed for a word to be considered in the TF-IDF score. Words that occur in more than 80% of the documents are ignored.
- `min_df=5`: The minimum document frequency allowed for a word to be considered in the TF-IDF score. Words that occur in less than 5 documents are ignored.
- `use_idf=True`: Whether or not to use inverse document frequency weighting in the TF-IDF score. Inverse document frequency is used to give more weight to words that are rare in the corpus.
These parameters were chosen based on empirical experimentation and are known to be effective in generating informative summaries.
